		//Defining Contracts: Interfaces allow you to define a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement.
		//By specifying the methods an implementing class must have,
		//interfaces ensure that classes adhere to a certain behavior or functionality.

		
		
		//Achieving Abstraction: Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction in Java. 
		//By programming to an interface rather than a specific implementation, 
		//you can write code that is decoupled from the actual classes implementing the interface. 
		//This promotes flexibility and modularity in your code.

		
		
		//Enabling Polymorphism: Interfaces are crucial for achieving polymorphism in Java.
		//By designing your code to depend on interfaces, you can write code that is agnostic to the specific implementation and can work with any class that implements the interface. This allows for interchangeable usage of different implementations, making your code more extensible and reusable.

		
		
		//Multiple Inheritance of Type: Unlike classes, which do not support multiple inheritance,
		//interfaces allow a class to implement multiple interfaces.
		//This enables a class to inherit and provide implementation for multiple contracts, providing greater flexibility and code reuse.

		
		
		//API Design and Documentation: Interfaces play a significant role in defining APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in Java.
		//They help establish a clear contract for how classes should interact with each other, making it easier to understand and use libraries or frameworks.
